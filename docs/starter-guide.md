# CSE Starter Guide (2025)

A no-BS roadmap for freshers to save years of trial-and-error.

---

## How to Use This Guide
- Read once, then take action in 1–2 hour blocks.
- Build projects from day 1. Learning by doing beats passive watching.
- Optimize for compounding: daily habits > short sprints.

---

## 0–30 Day Quick Start
- Install: VS Code, Git, a language runtime (Python or JavaScript), and GitHub.
- Learn basics: variables, loops, functions, arrays, objects.
- Push a small project to GitHub (calculator, to-do app, CLI tool).
- Create/refresh LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
- Join 1–2 active communities (Discord, WhatsApp, college clubs).

---

## 4-Year Compass (Adjust to your pace)
- Year 1: Programming foundations + 2–3 small projects + Git & GitHub + Linux basics/WSL + choose a domain to sample.
- Year 2: DSA basics + 3–5 medium projects + 1 open-source PR + apply for research or startup internships.
- Year 3: Advanced DSA (if doing product companies) + 2 strong portfolio projects + internships + networking.
- Year 4: Interview prep + system design basics + polish resume/portfolio + wide + targeted applications.

---

## Environment Setup
- OS: Windows + WSL (best beginner balance), macOS (great), Linux (powerful if you know why you need it). See `docs/linux.md`.
- Editor: VS Code (extensions: Prettier, ESLint, GitLens, Live Server, Python or Java extensions).
- Git & GitHub: install Git, set username/email, generate SSH key, push first repo.
- Terminal basics: `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `git status`, `git add/commit/push`.

---

## Learn One Language Well (then branch)
- If confused, pick one:
  - Python: easiest start, great for scripting, data, ML, backend.
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: web/mobile full‑stack, massive ecosystem.
  - Java: strong for interviews and backend roles.
- Focus topics (universal): data types, control flow, functions, arrays, strings, maps/objects, I/O, error handling, modules.
- Make 3–5 tiny projects while learning syntax.

---

## DSA — Practical Approach
- Why: Interviews, thinking skills, code clarity.
- What to learn first: arrays, strings, hash maps, stacks/queues, two pointers, sliding window, basic recursion, sorting/searching.
- Routine: 1–2 problems/day for 6–9 months. Track patterns, not problems.
- Resources: NeetCode patterns, Striver A2Z, LeetCode Top 150, GFG topic-wise.

---

## Projects That Actually Teach You
- Beginner (2–4 weeks total):
  - To‑do app, notes app, URL shortener, weather app, CLI habit tracker.
- Intermediate (1–2 months each):
  - Auth + CRUD app (e.g., task manager), blog with comments, file uploader, chat app, simple REST API.
- Advanced (2–3 months):
  - Real users + deployment + docs. Examples: SaaS mini tool, course tracker, code snippets manager, ML inference microservice.
- Golden rule: build, ship, document, and iterate. Each project gets a README, screenshots, demo link, and learnings.

---

## GitHub That Compounds
- Clean profile: pinned top 6 projects, short bio with keywords, location/timezone, contact links.
- Every repo:
  - Clear README (what/why/how/run), license, .gitignore, basic tests if possible.
  - Commits with meaningful messages. Issues + milestones for larger projects.
- Weekly habit: 3 commits, 1 issue closed, 1 README improvement, 1 learning note.
- See `docs/github.md` for a deep dive.

---

## Resume, Portfolio, LinkedIn
- Resume (1 page): impact bullets (Action + What + Result). Tailor to role. No fluff.
- Portfolio: minimal but real—hero, projects, about, contact. Add live demos.
- LinkedIn: strong headline, featured projects, consistent posting and comments. See `docs/linkedln.md`.

---

## Internships & Placements (High-Level)
- 1st year: learn + projects + hackathons.
- 2nd year: early internships (startups, professors) + open source.
- 3rd year: targeted internship prep (DSA + projects + networking).
- 4th year: full-time prep (company sheets + mock interviews + referrals).
- Off‑campus: LinkedIn + AngelList/Wellfound + company career pages + alumni outreach.

---

## Choose a Domain (Sample, then Commit)
- Try 2–3 domains for 2–4 weeks each. Decide by enjoyment + momentum + job demand.
- Common paths: see `docs/domain/` pages.
- Rule: depth beats breadth. 1 strong domain + solid fundamentals > 6 partial starts.

---

## Daily/Weekly Operating System
- Daily (60–120 min): 30–45 min learning + 30–60 min building + 15 min notes/cleanup.
- Weekly: 1 LinkedIn post, 1 project improvement, 1 new concept, 1 networking message.
- Monthly: ship something new; update resume/portfolio.

---

## Common Pitfalls (Avoid These)
- Tutorial hell (no projects), zero documentation, ignoring Git, chasing too many domains, ghosting LinkedIn, over‑optimizing tools, never shipping.

---

## Curated Starters
- YouTube: freeCodeCamp, Fireship, The Primeagen (for dev), Jenny’s lectures (theory).
- Blogs: engineering blogs from FAANG/startups (see daily reading section).
- Roadmaps: roadmap.sh (as a reference, not a checklist).

---

## First‑Semester Checklist
- Installed tools + first repo pushed.
- One language basics + 2 small projects.
- GitHub profile cleaned + 3 pinned repos.
- Resume v1 + LinkedIn updated.
- Wrote and posted a short learning note.

You’re on track. Keep shipping.
