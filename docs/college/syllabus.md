## Why the College Syllabus Can Be Outdated

* **Rigid Approval Process:** Most colleges follow a syllabus designed and approved by universities or education boards, which can take years to update.
* **Lack of Autonomy:** Many colleges are **not autonomous**, meaning they must stick to the university’s prescribed syllabus without much flexibility.
* **Rapid Tech Changes:** Technology evolves fast, but the syllabus updates slowly — often missing out on the latest trends like AI, cloud computing, or cutting-edge tools.
* **Resource Constraints:** Some colleges may lack faculty with expertise in the newest technologies or access to updated labs and materials.
* **Focus on Fundamentals:** Colleges tend to prioritize core theory and foundational concepts over trending tools or niche technologies.
