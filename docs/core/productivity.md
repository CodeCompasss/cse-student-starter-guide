# ⚡ Productivity Tools & Tricks for Developers

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

Top developers prefer **keyboard over mouse** because it saves time. Every second adds up.

* Learn system-wide shortcuts (copy, paste, switch windows).
* Learn app-specific shortcuts (e.g., VS Code, terminal, browser).
* Use tools like **Vim keybindings** to navigate without touching the mouse.

### 🌐 Browsers with Vim Keybindings

* Extensions like **Vimium (Chrome/Firefox)** let you browse the web like Vim:

  * `j/k` = scroll up/down
  * `h/l` = left/right
  * `f` = open links with keys
    👉 No need to move your hand to the mouse—super fast.

### 📝 Vim & Neovim

* **Vim** → A powerful text editor inside the terminal.
* **Neovim** → A modern version of Vim, faster and more extensible.

**Why top developers use Neovim:**

* Keyboard-first (no mouse needed).
* Highly customizable with **Lua plugins**.
* Lightweight, runs in the terminal.
* Makes editing code insanely fast once you master it.

### 💡 Zed Editor

* A new modern editor (by creators of Atom).
* Combines **speed (like Neovim)** with **collaboration features (like Google Docs)**.
* Minimal, beautiful UI + supports team coding in real-time.
* Many developers are testing it as a **future alternative** to VS Code.

### 🖼️ Tiling Window Manager (TWM)

Instead of overlapping windows:

* Your screen is split into **tiles** (terminal, editor, browser side by side).
* Controlled fully by **keyboard shortcuts**.
* Saves time switching apps → massive productivity boost.

Popular TWMs:

* **i3 / sway** (Linux)
* **bspwm** (Linux)
* **Aerospace / Yabai** (macOS)
* **FancyZones** (Windows with PowerToys)
