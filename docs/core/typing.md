# ⌨️ Touch Typing: Why It Matters

Typing is one of the most essential skills for students and professionals. The way you type can affect your **speed, accuracy, and comfort**.

### 🔹 What is Touch Typing?

**Touch typing** is the skill of typing without looking at the keyboard. You use **all ten fingers**, and each key has a fixed “home position.” With practice, your fingers learn where the keys are through **muscle memory**.

### 🔹 What if You Only Type with 2 Fingers?

Many beginners use the **hunt-and-peck method**—typing with 2 fingers while constantly looking at the keyboard.

* ✅ It works, but…
* ❌ It’s slow (usually under 30–40 words per minute).
* ❌ More prone to mistakes.
* ❌ Causes finger strain over long typing sessions.


### 🔹 Which is Fastest?

* **Touch Typing** is the fastest and most efficient. Skilled touch typists easily reach **70–100+ words per minute**, compared to 30–40 with 2 fingers.

👉 **In short:** Touch typing is the fastest and most reliable way to type. If you’re stuck typing with 2 fingers, start practicing touch typing early—it will save you time, reduce errors, and make you more productive in studies and work.
