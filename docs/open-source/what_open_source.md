# 🌍 What is Open Source?

**Open source** means software whose **source code is publicly available** for anyone to **view, use, modify, and share**. Instead of being locked by one company, the code is open to the community.

## ✅ Key points about open source

* **Source code available** — You can see exactly how it works.
* **Free to use** (mostly) — Anyone can download and run it.
* **Community-driven** — Developers around the world contribute, fix bugs, and add features.
* **Collaborative learning** — Great way for students to practice real-world coding.

## 🔎 Examples of Open Source Software

* **Linux** (operating system)
* **Android** (mobile OS core)
* **Python** (programming language ecosystem)
* **VS Code** (code editor)
* **Firefox** (browser)
* **TensorFlow, PyTorch** (AI/ML frameworks)

## 🚀 Why Open Source matters for students (especially CSE)

1. **Learning from real projects** — You see how professionals write production-level code.
2. **Hands-on practice** — Fixing bugs or adding features builds your skills.
3. **Resume booster** — Recruiters love candidates with open-source contributions.
4. **Networking** — You collaborate with developers across the world.
5. **Opportunities** — Programs like **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** and **Hacktoberfest** reward contributors.

## ⚡ The harsh truth

* It can feel overwhelming at first (big codebases, strict contribution rules).
* But even **small contributions** (fixing typos, improving docs) count — and help you learn the workflow (GitHub, pull requests, version control).

👉 In short:
**Open Source = Free + Transparent + Collaborative Software Development.**
For CSE students, it’s one of the **fastest ways to grow skills, build a network, and get noticed**.
