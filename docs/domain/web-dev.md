## What Is Web Development?

Web development is the process of building websites and web applications that run on the internet. When you visit a website, everything you see—texts, images, buttons, forms—is created and managed by web developers.

Web development is divided into two main parts:

* **Front-end development:** This is everything the user interacts with directly on the website or app. It includes the layout, design, and interactive elements like buttons and menus.
* **Back-end development:** This involves the server-side logic that powers the website behind the scenes. It handles data storage, user authentication, and communication with databases.

Together, front-end and back-end development create a seamless user experience.
