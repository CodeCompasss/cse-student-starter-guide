# Cybersecurity: What It Is and What You Need to Know

## What Is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, software, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, damage, or theft. It’s like being a digital security guard, making sure systems stay safe from hackers, viruses, and other online threats.

With the world becoming increasingly digital, cybersecurity helps protect personal information, company data, and even national security.
