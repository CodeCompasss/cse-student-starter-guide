# Data Science: What It Is and What You Need to Know

## What Is Data Science?

Data Science is the process of **extracting meaningful insights and knowledge from data**. It combines statistics, programming, and domain expertise to analyze large datasets, find patterns, and help organizations make informed decisions.

Data scientists work with data from many sources — like websites, apps, sensors, or business operations — to solve real-world problems such as predicting customer behavior, detecting fraud, or recommending products.

## What Do Data Scientists Do?

* **Collect and clean data:** Raw data is often messy. Data scientists preprocess it to remove errors and inconsistencies.
* **Explore and analyze data:** Use statistics and visualization to understand trends and relationships.
* **Build predictive models:** Apply machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes like sales, churn, or risk.
* **Communicate insights:** Create reports and dashboards to explain findings to non-technical stakeholders.
* **Collaborate:** Work with business teams, engineers, and analysts to turn data into actionable strategies.
* **Deploy models:** Sometimes, data scientists help put models into production for real-time use.
* **Stay updated:** Continuously learn new tools and techniques as the field evolves rapidly.
