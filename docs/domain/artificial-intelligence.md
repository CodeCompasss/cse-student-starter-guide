## What Is AI/ML?

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the broader concept of machines or software simulating human intelligence — like reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, and perception.
* **Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of AI where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every task.

In simple terms, AI is the idea of smart machines, and ML is how they learn to get smart by analyzing data.
