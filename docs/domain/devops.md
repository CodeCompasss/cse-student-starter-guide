## What Is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices and cultural philosophies that **bridge the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops)**. The goal is to deliver applications and services **faster, more reliably, and with higher quality**.

Instead of developers writing code and "throwing it over the wall" to operations teams, DevOps promotes collaboration, automation, and continuous feedback to streamline the entire software delivery lifecycle.

Think of DevOps as the glue that connects building software and running software—making sure new features reach users quickly and systems stay stable.

## What Do DevOps Engineers Do?

* **Automate software deployment:** Write scripts and use tools to automate the process of getting code from development into production environments without manual errors.
* **Manage infrastructure:** Provision and maintain servers, databases, cloud resources, and networking using code (Infrastructure as Code).
* **Monitor applications and systems:** Track performance, uptime, and errors to detect and fix issues proactively.
* **Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Set up pipelines where code is automatically tested and deployed with minimal human intervention.
* **Collaborate across teams:** Work closely with developers, QA, and operations to improve workflows and system reliability.
* **Secure systems:** Integrate security checks into the development pipeline (DevSecOps) to prevent vulnerabilities.
* **Troubleshoot production issues:** Quickly respond to outages or bugs in live systems, minimizing downtime.
* **Optimize performance and scalability:** Ensure applications can handle growing numbers of users without breaking.

## What You Need to Learn to Become a DevOps Engineer

### Core Skills

* **Linux & Shell scripting:** Most servers run Linux; you must be comfortable with command-line tools and scripting to automate tasks.
* **Cloud platforms:** Familiarity with AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for provisioning infrastructure.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, or Ansible to manage infrastructure through code.
* **CI/CD pipelines:** Using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI to automate testing and deployment.
* **Containerization:** Docker for packaging applications and Kubernetes for orchestrating container clusters.
* **Configuration management:** Tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to automate system configuration.
* **Monitoring and logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Datadog, or Splunk.
* **Version control:** Git is essential for managing code and collaborating.
* **Networking basics:** Understanding DNS, load balancers, firewalls, VPNs, and routing.
* **Security basics:** Familiarity with concepts like TLS, authentication, secrets management, and vulnerability scanning.

### Helpful Skills

* **Scripting languages:** Python, Bash, or Go to build automation scripts.
* **Agile and Scrum methodologies:** Working in fast-paced teams that iterate quickly.
* **Soft skills:** Communication and collaboration are vital since DevOps connects multiple teams.
* **Problem-solving mindset:** Diagnosing issues quickly under pressure.
