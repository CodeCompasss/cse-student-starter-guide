# Robotics Software Development: What It Is and What You Need to Know

## What Is Robotics Software Development?

Robotics software development involves designing and programming the brains of robots and automated machines. Robots can range from simple industrial arms used in factories to complex autonomous drones and self-driving cars. The software controls how these machines perceive their environment, make decisions, and perform tasks.

In short, robotics developers write code that makes physical devices **sense, think, and act** in the real world.
