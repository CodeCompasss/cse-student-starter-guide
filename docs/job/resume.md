# 📄 What is a Resume & Why You Must Build One Early as a CSE Student

A **resume** is a **1–2 page document** that summarizes your **skills, education, projects, and achievements**. It is the first thing recruiters, professors, or organizers look at when you apply for an **internship, scholarship, hackathon, or placement**.

---

## ✅ Why you should make your resume **as soon as possible**

* **Lightning opportunities** — Sometimes you’ll see an internship/hackathon/scholarship with just 24–48 hours to apply. If you don’t already have a resume, you’ll miss out.
* **First-year advantage** — You may think you don’t have much to put in, but even basic projects, coding practice, or school achievements count. Start now, improve later.
* **Seniority pressure** — Seniors often say “Send me your resume fast, I’ll refer you.” Without one ready, you lose the chance.
* **Professional habit** — Building a resume early makes you **track your progress** and forces you to build projects/skills to fill it.
