# ðŸ“˜ Engineering Blogs â€“ Learn from the Real World

## ðŸ‘‹ What Are Engineering Blogs?

Engineering blogs are written by software engineers and tech teams at companies like Google, Netflix, Meta, and startups. They share how they build, scale, and maintain real-world systems â€” including their **tools, mistakes, challenges, and solutions**.

These blogs are like open books of **industry-level experience** â€” and theyâ€™re free!
