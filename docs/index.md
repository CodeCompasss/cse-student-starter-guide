## 👋 About This Project – CSE Starter Guide Kit

Hi, my name is **Shadil**, and I’m the founder of **CodeCompass**.

I started this project as a way to **give back** — not just to my juniors, but to anyone walking the same path I did. I'm not some “special guy,” topper, or big-shot — I’m just someone who knows how confusing and overwhelming the Computer Science journey can feel when you’re starting out.

When I was a beginner, I often wished someone had given me a **single, clear roadmap** — not filled with vague advice or outdated theory, but with **practical things that actually help**, like:

* What domains exist and what they really mean
* What tools, platforms, and habits matter
* What seniors never say out loud but make a huge difference
* What companies actually look for
* What top students do differently that no one teaches in class

So I built this **CSE Starter Kit** as a curated, no-fluff collection of the most essential topics, tools, blogs, paths, habits, and opportunities — not to make you perfect, but to **save you time** and **help you make smarter decisions**.

## 🧭 What This Guide Is About

This is not some “guaranteed placement formula.” Life doesn’t work like that. You could get placed in Google even without a LinkedIn profile — but **having LinkedIn could open 10x more doors**.

Same thing applies across your journey — college syllabus might not teach AI, but that doesn’t mean you can’t. Most of what will shape your career will come from **outside your textbooks**.

That’s what this guide is here for.

## 🚀 Why I Made This Kit

* So you don’t waste hours Googling “what is devops” or “which blogs to follow”
* So you don't miss scholarships or internships just because no one told you
* So you understand how tech works **in the real world**, not just in theory
* So you don’t feel lost — even when your college isn’t very supportive
* So you get a small head start — because sometimes, that’s all you need

## 🧠 What’s Inside

This kit covers a wide range of topics, including:

* Clear breakdowns of each CS domain (Web Dev, AI/ML, Cybersecurity, etc.)
* Roadmaps for how to get started
* Must-know tools, habits, and platforms (GitHub, Substack, Notion, etc.)
* Career insights (placements, off-campus jobs, resumes, and more)
* The stuff that **top engineers and creators read, follow, and do**
* And… all the things I wish I knew earlier

## ✨ Final Note

I’ve taken the time to include insights from the **best minds in tech**, real advice from seniors, and **practical shortcuts** that you’ll never find in a classroom. You might not need everything today, but one day something in this kit will help you — maybe even change your path.

Explore it at your own pace.

Use it to grow.

And remember — **you don’t have to be the best, you just have to start**.
