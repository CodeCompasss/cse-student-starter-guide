### 🌟 Best way to use YouTube effectively

1. **Subscribe wisely** — follow 5–6 quality channels instead of 50 random ones.
2. **Make playlists** — group videos (DSA, OS, DBMS) to revise easily.
3. **Follow schedules** — treat a playlist like a mini-course and finish it.
4. **Engage** — comment, ask questions, and network with peers in live sessions.
5. **Create** — if confident, upload your own projects or explain concepts — it builds your personal brand.

### ⚠️ Reality check

* YouTube can distract you (entertainment vs learning).
* Not all videos are correct — always cross-check with books or official docs.
* Depth is sometimes missing — for mastery, combine with textbooks/courses.
