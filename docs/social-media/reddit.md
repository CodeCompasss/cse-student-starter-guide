# 🌐 What is Reddit?

**Reddit** is one of the world’s largest online communities, often called “the front page of the internet.” It is a platform where millions of people share news, ideas, discussions, and memes every day.

### 🔹 How Reddit Works

* **Subreddits**: Reddit is divided into communities called *subreddits*, each focused on a topic (e.g., `r/programming`, `r/movies`, `r/India`).
* **Posts**: Users create posts (text, images, videos, links).
* **Upvotes & Downvotes**: Instead of “likes,” posts are voted up or down. Popular posts rise to the top.
* **Comments**: Every post has a comment thread where people discuss, debate, and share knowledge.

### 💡 Why People Use Reddit

1. **Knowledge Sharing** – You can learn programming, cooking, finance, or almost anything.
2. **Community Support** – Subreddits exist for mental health, careers, hobbies, etc.
3. **Entertainment** – Memes, funny stories, and trending news appear daily.
4. **Networking** – Many professionals hang out in tech subreddits, helping students and beginners.

### ⚠️ Things to Keep in Mind

* Reddit is open and diverse—some communities are helpful, others may be toxic.
* Follow subreddit rules (each has its own).
* Don’t just consume—**contribute** (ask, answer, share).

👉 **In short:** Reddit is a mix of forums, social media, and knowledge hubs. Whether you want to learn coding, stay updated on world events, or relax with memes, there’s a subreddit for you.
