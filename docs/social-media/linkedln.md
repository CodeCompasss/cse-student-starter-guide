## üö® If You‚Äôre Not on LinkedIn Now, You‚Äôre Invisible to the Tech World

> **Every day you delay showing up on LinkedIn, you're compounding in the wrong direction.**

In CSE, you can be **super skilled** and still get **zero opportunities** if people don't know you exist.
LinkedIn changes that.

It‚Äôs not ‚Äújust another social media‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **public record of your potential**.
People are watching. People are listening. Recruiters, seniors, managers, even potential co-founders.

## üí• Why LinkedIn is a Career Cheat Code

### 1. **Compound Effect of Visibility**

* A comment today can lead to a referral a year from now.
* A project you post can show up in a recruiter‚Äôs search.
* A senior you impress might mentor you or hire you later.

> 10 minutes a week on LinkedIn over 3 years may outperform any single internship in long-term return.

---

### 2. **Your Online Reputation Starts Here**

Recruiters and companies:

* Google your name.
* Land on your LinkedIn.
* Decide in seconds if you're **interesting**, **smart**, or just another "CSE student".

If your LinkedIn is empty, outdated, or boring ‚Üí you're gone.

### 3. **Opportunities Will Find You** (This is real)

You won't always have to **apply**. When your profile grows:

* Recruiters message **you**.
* Juniors follow your work.
* Seniors recommend you.
* Mentors and founders notice you.

> There are many  seniors reach out to juniors because of a simple post. One project update led to a freelance gig. Another got me invited to a private dev group.

### üë• Recommendations and Endorsements

### üîç Recruiters Use LinkedIn Search Like Google

* ‚ÄúFinal-year CSE backend dev‚Äù

Make sure those **keywords are in your headline, skills, or projects**.
You‚Äôll start showing up ‚Äî even without applying.
